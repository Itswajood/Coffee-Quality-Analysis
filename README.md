# Coffee Quality Analysis - A Data-Driven Approach

## Project Overview
The **Coffee Quality Analysis** project utilizes **Power BI** and dataset insights from the **Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)** to assess and improve coffee bean quality. By analyzing key factors such as **flavor, aroma, moisture, and processing methods**, this project identifies **the best coffee varieties** and suggests ways to enhance coffee production.

## Key Features
- **Data-Driven Coffee Evaluation** – Analyzes coffee beans based on quality measures.
- **Comparative Study** – Compares **Arabica** and **Robusta** coffee to determine the superior variety.
- **Sales Performance Insights** – Identifies factors contributing to declining **Robusta coffee sales**.
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard** – Visualizes coffee production, quality metrics, and supplier trends.
- **Production & Supplier Analysis** – Examines coffee production by country, supplier ranking, and bag distribution.
- **Quality Improvement Strategies** – Provides insights on how to enhance coffee quality and sales.

## Technology Used
- **Power BI** – For data visualization and analysis.
- **Excel & Data Querying** – To structure and preprocess datasets.
- **Data Sourcing** – Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) database.
- **Statistical & Visual Analytics** – Pie charts, bar graphs, and trend analysis for in-depth insights.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Acquiring coffee quality datasets.
2. **Data Processing** – Cleaning and structuring the data.
3. **Visualization Development** – Creating interactive charts and reports in Power BI.
4. **Analysis & Insights** – Studying patterns, trends, and coffee quality factors.
5. **Recommendations** – Suggesting improvements for coffee production and marketing.

## Key Findings
- **Arabica coffee** is the highest-rated variety based on quality assessments.
- **Washed/Wet processing** yields better coffee quality compared to other methods.
- **Ethiopia produces the best quality coffee**, making it a preferred sourcing country.
- **Colombia** is the largest supplier of coffee bags.
- **Japan has high-quality coffee but low production**, highlighting a potential market gap.

## Future Enhancements
- **Refining the dataset** with more recent data for better insights.
- **Expanding the dashboard** to include real-time coffee market trends.
- **Developing predictive models** for coffee quality based on growing conditions.
- **Integrating customer feedback** into the analysis to assess consumer preferences.

## Recommendations
- **Coffee shop owners** should prioritize Arabica coffee for better quality and taste.
- **Sourcing Ethiopian coffee** can enhance product quality and customer satisfaction.
- **Marketing strategies** should focus on increasing Robusta coffee demand to address sales decline.
- **Countries with low production but high quality (e.g., Japan) should expand their coffee farming initiatives.**


## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of **data-driven decision-making in coffee production and sales**. Through **Power BI analytics**, we identified **quality trends, key production regions, and opportunities for improvement** in the coffee industry. Future expansions will further enhance the study by integrating **customer feedback and advanced predictive modeling**.
